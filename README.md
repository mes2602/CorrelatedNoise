Markdown:
1) variable list
Graphs:
Many graphs, showing accuracy, decision time, and percent of trials split by k (k = num independent observations) and by amount of evidence (evidence collected in either 1 or 2 unit increments, with results given for both even and odd threshold sizes).

Further exploration of behavior of k-splitting. 
Many graphs comparing distribution of trials split by amount of time taken vs k and accuracy.
